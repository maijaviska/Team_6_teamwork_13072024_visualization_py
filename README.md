Start with Task 1 and proceed further as complexity will increase:
To complete the tasks use 'transaction_dataset.csv'
Task 1: Create a bar chart that shows the count of transactions for each unique value in the 'Gender' column (including NaN values). - easy
Task 2: Create a horizontal bar chart that shows the top 5 most frequent names in the DataFrame, based on the 'name' column. (First, create a grouped DataFrame (name_df), then filter it using iloc, and finally create the visualization.) -medium
Task 3: Create a filtered DataFrame that includes Category == 'Clothing' and Gender == 'M'. How many rows are there in this filtered DataFrame? Format the result as follows: The filtered DataFrame has XXXX rows. - hard
